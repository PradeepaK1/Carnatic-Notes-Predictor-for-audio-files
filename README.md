# DIVA_CODERS

Description:

- This is a python based application which enables its users to get the carnatic notes for the tunes they upload or record.
- This application is built with Streamlit and the technique behind the working is neural networks 

- The base code for execution can be executed in anaconda navigator (Jupyter Lab Terminal) after synchronizing with the dataset 
- Install the requirements and in the terminal type the command:

streamlit run project.py

Attached Files: 

- Dataset 

- Abstract

- Demo video 

- Source files

- Presentation

- Examples
      - Examples 1 and 2 for carnatic tunes
      - Example 3 is for western tunes

Note: Since notes2 has larger size of dataset it may lag or take a longer time based on the system RAM for execution, thus for demonstration or verification purposes notes1 can be kept as root directory for dataset
